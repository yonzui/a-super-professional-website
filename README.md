We thought it'd be cool to develop a music generator that reccomends music based on your mood. Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and enter a prompt to describe how you're feeling. You can also click on the "The Vibes" button, and hover over the feelings to see a cool emoij effect. We made this usng HTML, CSS, and Javascript on Visual Studio Code.

// Challenges
The AI Generator was difficult to implement since we tried using an OpenAPI key at first. We were able to combat this by making a "fake" AI generator. We also had some trouble with the emoji effect button, as well as the gradient in the background when you hover over a certain spot. Through this project, we were able to learn more about API keys and how they work, as well as some additional javascript skills.
